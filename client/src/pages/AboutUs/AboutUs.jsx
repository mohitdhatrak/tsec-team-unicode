            This is a project build by four engineering visonaries/dreamers/web
            developers/undergraduates- Aman Nambisan Devansh Ashar Mohit Dhatrak
            Yuvraj Rasal Our project aims at helping people collaborate with
            each other and exchange goods hence being a E-barter sytem. As the
            saying goes- One mans trash is likely another mans treasure! Users
            can fill in the necessary details to list their products for other
            users to contemplate. Our advanced algorithim looks at the current
            market pricing and takes into consideration the details of the
            product to provide the consumer with a fair price after our
            evaluation. This greatly reduces the chances of scams and promotes
            more transperency in deals. Further consumers can flag wrongly
            marked products and give ratings based on their experience with
            sellers to avoid furhter discrepency.Hence highly rated users can
            act as inspiration for further users
